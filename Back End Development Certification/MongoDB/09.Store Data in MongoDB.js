//3rd assgn: FIND
/*
Here we will learn how to search for documents.

In this exercise the database name is learnyoumongo.
So, the url would be something like: mongodb://localhost:27017/learnyoumongo

Use the parrots collection to find all documents where age
is greater than the first argument passed to your script.

Using console.log, print the documents to stdout.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

To connect to the database, one can use something like this:

    var mongo = require('mongodb').MongoClient
    mongo.connect(url, function(err, db) {
      // db gives access to the database
    })

To get a collection, one can use db.collection('<collection name>').

To find a document or documents, one needs to call find() on the collection.

Find is a little bit different than what we are used to seeing.

To access the arguments you can use the process.argv array of strings (the first argument is stored at the third position process.argv[2]). To convert to an integer, you could use parseInt()

Here is an example:

    collection.find({
      name: 'foo'
    }).toArray(function(err, documents) {
    
    })

If your program does not finish executing, you may have forgotten to
close the db. That can be done by calling db.close() after you
have finished.


*/
var mongo = require('mongodb').MongoClient
var age = process.argv[2]

var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'


// Database Name
const dbName = 'learnyoumongo';

mongo.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  if (err) throw err;
  
  const db = client.db(dbName);
  
  var parrots = db.collection('parrots')
  parrots.find({
    age: {
      $gt: +age
    }
  }).toArray(function(err, docs) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(docs)
    client.close()
  })
})

//4th assgn: FIND PROJECT
/*
Here we will learn how to search for documents but only fetch the fields
we need. Also known as projection in MongoDB

Use the parrots collection from the database named learnyoumongo to
find all documents where age is greater than the first argument
passed to your script.

The difference from the last lesson will be that we only want the
name and age properties

Using console.log, print the documents to stdout.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

To find a document or documents, one needs to call find() on the collection.

Find is a little bit different than what we are used to seeing.

Here is an example:

    collection.find({
      name: 'foo'
    }, {
      name: 1
    , age: 1
    , _id: 0
    }).toArray(function(err, documents) {
    
    })

If your program does not finish executing, you may have forgotten to
close the db. That can be done by calling db.close() after you
have finished.

*/
var mongo = require('mongodb').MongoClient
var age = process.argv[2]

var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'

// Database Name
const dbName = 'learnyoumongo';

mongo.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  if (err) throw err;
  const db = client.db(dbName);
  const parrots = db.collection('parrots')
  parrots.find({
    age: {
      $gt: +age
    }
  }).project({ _id: 0, name: 1, age: 1}).toArray(function(err, docs) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(docs)
    client.close()
  })
})

//5th assgn: INSERT
/*
Connect to MongoDB on port 27017.
You should connect to the database named learnyoumongo and insert
a document into the docs collection.

The document should be a json document with the following properties:

  * `firstName`
  * `lastName`

firstName will be passed as the first argument to the lesson.

lastName will be passed as the second argument to the lesson.

Use console.log to print out the object used to create the document.

Make sure you use JSON.stringify convert it to JSON.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

Remember, one can access the arguments passed by using process.argv.

In order to use the mongo package, one must first require it like:

    var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient

To connect, use the connect() function of MongoClient.

Ex.

    MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {
      if (err) throw err

    })

If you get a Connection Refused error, make sure that mongod is still
running.

After you have successfully connected, you will need to specify a collection.
That can be done by calling the collection() function on the db returned
in the callback to connect.

Say you wanted to specify a collection named users:

    var collection = db.collection('users')

To insert a document, one would need to call insert() on the collection, like this:


    // inserting document
    // { a : 2 }
    collection.insert({
      a: 2
    }, function(err, data) {
      // handle error
    
      // other operations
    })

If your program does not finish executing, you may have forgotten to
close the db. That can be done by calling db.close() after you
have finished.

*/
var mongo = require('mongodb').MongoClient

var firstName = process.argv[2]
var lastName = process.argv[3]
var doc = {
  firstName: firstName
, lastName: lastName
}

var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'

// Database Name
const dbName = 'learnyoumongo';

mongo.connect(url, function(err, client) {
  if (err) throw err;
  const db = client.db(dbName);
  
  const collection = db.collection('docs')
  collection.insert(doc, function(err, data) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(JSON.stringify(doc))
    client.close()
  })
})

//6th assgn: UPDATE
/*
Here we are going to update a document in the users collection.

The database name will be accessible via process.argv[2].

Say we have a user defined like:

    {
      "name": "Tina",
      "age": 30,
      "username": "tinatime"
    }

We want to change Tina's age from 30 to 40.

For the purpose of this lesson, assume that the username property is unique.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HINTS

To update a document, one would need to call update() on the collection.

Ex.

    
    // document
    // { a: 2, b: 3 }
    
    collection.update({
      a: 2
    }, {
      $set: {
        b: 1
      }
    }, callback)
    
    // document was updated
    // { a: 2, b: 1 }

The first argument to update() is the query. This query is what filters the documents that we are wanting to update. The second argument is an object of the properties to update. Pay close attention to the $set property. If we were to omit $set, the document would be replaced with the object represented by the second argument.

If your program does not finish executing, you may have forgotten to
close the db. That can be done by calling db.close() after you
have finished.
